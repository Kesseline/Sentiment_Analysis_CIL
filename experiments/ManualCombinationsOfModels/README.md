# Manual model combinations

This code was used to compute similarities between model prediction and to manually combine multiple methods based on the classification probabilities.

similarity_of_model_predictions.py computes the similarity percentage of different models based on the submission files in the submission_files folder.

combination_of_models.py creates a submission file based on the predictions of different models.
